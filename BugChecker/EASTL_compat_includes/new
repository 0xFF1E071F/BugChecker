// This empty file is required to compile EASTL. The folder in which this file is saved must
// be put earlier in the include path of the BugChecker project. If BugChecker is compiled
// without this file, the EASTL header files would include the "new." file from the WDK,
// preventing the project from compiling.
//
// This dirty hack is required in an effort to modify the original sources of EASTL as little as
// possible...
//
// The only change required in the sources of EASTL to be compiled with the WDK for Windows XP
// and therefore with BugChecker, is #undefining the "EA_COMPILER_HAS_INTTYPES" identifier in the
// "eabase.h" file.
